      "feedback": "Report fails to meet quality standards due to critical structural and content deficiencies. While the report demonstrates awareness of EuroTrans Logistics' multi-jurisdictional complexity and provides contextually relevant recommendations, it fundamentally fails its core mandate by providing zero legal changes analysis. The report is essentially a 'compliance audit request' rather than a compliance report. The empty 'legal_changes' array combined with 'overall_risk: high' rating creates a report that cannot actually inform compliance decisions. Additionally, the reliance on hypothetical scenarios without data undermines credibility. For a compliance report to be useful, it must either: (1) provide actual regulatory findings with proper citations, or (2) clearly explain why findings cannot be provided due to data access limitations in the summary before generating actionable recommendations. This report does the latter but frames it as a completed assessment rather than a preliminary findings report. The JSON structure is valid, but the content does not constitute a quality compliance report suitable for operational decision-making.",

        "MAJOR: No baseline compliance status established - report cannot determine if company is currently compliant or non-compliant, only identifies what should be checked.",
        "MAJOR: Route impact assessments are speculative without regulatory data - recommendations describe what 'cannot be verified' rather than what was found, reducing practical utility.",
