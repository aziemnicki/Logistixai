      "feedback": "Report demonstrates strong structure and comprehensiveness but has critical deficiencies that prevent approval. The most significant issues are: (1) Complete absence of source citations despite detailed legal claims - all source_url fields are null, which is unacceptable for compliance reporting; (2) Several regulatory claims lack verification and contain specificity that appears unsupported (e.g., exact penalty amounts, specific percentages); (3) Risk levels may be overstated - marking 5 of 8 changes as 'high' or 'critical' without source justification reduces credibility; (4) The report claims Switzerland has 'Euro V equivalent' standards when Switzerland has its own EURO standards system; (5) Missing reference dates and regulatory bodies for cited regulations. While the report is well-organized, actionable, and appropriately tailored to the company, it cannot be approved without proper sourcing and verification of legal claims.",

      "feedback": "Report demonstrates transparency about data limitations but falls short of quality standards for a logistics compliance report. The critical issue is that the report is built on empty search results, rendering it unable to fulfill its core purpose: identifying actual regulatory changes and compliance risks. While the report appropriately acknowledges this limitation and recommends independent verification, it lacks the substantive analysis expected of a compliance document. The recommendations, though well-organized, are generic rather than tailored to EuroTrans's specific operations. Risk assessments appear conservative due to missing data. For approval, the report must be regenerated with actual regulatory research, include specific citations to current regulations, provide concrete compliance requirements for each country, and establish realistic deadlines for high-priority actions.",
      "issues": [
        "Empty search results: Report is built on no data sources, severely limiting its analytical value and accuracy",
        "Lack of specificity: Recommendations are generic guidance rather than concrete requirements for EuroTrans's specific routes and cargo types",
        "Missing regulatory citations: No references to specific EU directives, national regulations, or international agreements relevant to the company's operations",
        "No deadlines provided: All high-priority actions lack completion deadlines, limiting actionability",
        "Incomplete risk assessment: Risk levels cannot be properly evaluated without actual regulatory information",
        "Missing perishable goods detail: Report identifies perishable cargo but provides no specific standards or regulations for refrigerated transport compliance",
        "Switzerland coverage insufficient: Given the France-Italy route transits Switzerland, the report should provide specific Swiss regulatory requirements rather than general recommendations",
        "No baseline compliance data: Report does not establish current compliance status before recommending improvements",
        "Vague verification references: Repeated mentions of 'independent verification' without providing sources or frameworks"

      "feedback": "This report fails to meet quality standards across all evaluation criteria. The report appears to be a placeholder or incomplete draft rather than a comprehensive compliance analysis. It provides no substantive analysis of EuroTrans Logistics' operations despite having detailed company profile information including 28 vehicles, 3 international routes, and specific compliance focus areas. The company operates across multiple countries (DE, FR, BE, NL, IT, CH) with perishable cargo requiring specific regulatory oversight, yet the report contains no legal changes, route impact analysis, or actionable recommendations. The 'Report generation in progress' key takeaway and zero search results indicate the analysis was not completed. A medium risk rating is assigned without justification or supporting evidence.",
